# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -11: December 29, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Started something to be seen once Kionami code is entered. 

**Thoughts:** Using current repository for my website to store projects for 100DaysOfCode. 

**Link to work:** [Kionami](https://github.com/latinadeveloper/isistejeda.com/commit/e2a0d37cd8145d517abe26c9f2b9a7002d2e5c40)

### Day -10: December 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Mimis image uploaded to be shown when the code is entered. 

**Thoughts:** Had to look up the different properties of document.(property). It took longer than expected to find the one that I wanted. 
Changed the day count to -10, to start with everyone else on the 9th.

### Day -9: December 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Align table(tiles) to start revealing Mimis.

**Thoughts:** Aligning tables to images is trickier than I thought.
