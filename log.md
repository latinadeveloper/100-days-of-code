# 100 Days Of Code
**Thoughts:**   I have attempted this, twice. Doing it everyday has been challenging. For the most part I have been coding mostly during the week and maybe one day on the weekend. It has become a bit of a habit now, but I am still lacking the continuous streak. I have modified and taken away the thoughts of the template and it will only have my link and what I Worked on.
