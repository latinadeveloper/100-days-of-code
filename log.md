# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 19, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Started something to be seen once Kionami code is entered. 

**Thoughts:** Using current repository for my website to store projects for 100DaysOfCode. 

**Link to work:** [Kionami](https://github.com/latinadeveloper/isistejeda.com/commit/e2a0d37cd8145d517abe26c9f2b9a7002d2e5c40)
