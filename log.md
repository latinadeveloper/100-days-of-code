# 100 Days Of Code

### Day 1: March 22 , 2017  
**Why again**: After an inconsistent streak of days of being unable to code on a daily basis due to life events that take priority. Part of the rules are to code and log and tweet everyday. The not tweeting every day is part of the rules and I am intersted in trying to see if I can actually follow this. Back to day 1. I have been starting to code again for a couple of days consistently and wanted to do that before I start this log again. I am a bit curious to see how many people actually code consistently and do the tweet everyday. 
**Today's Progress**: Working on finishing the details of the TTT, this one took a while. 
**Thoughts:**    I really do not want to reset my log again to day 1.
